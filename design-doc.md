## Design Docs

### User Stories

- **Initial Setup**:
    - As a new user I want to run a setup script that takes my information and populates the database.
- **Morning Routine**:
    - As a user I want a morning cronjob to force me to interact with the app to pull me into an intentional space. This should ask me to remember my dreams before anything else, then remind me of my successes and failures from the previous day. It should then ask me to set one or two main intentions for my day today.
- **Evening Routine**:
    - As a user I want an evening cronjob to force me to report my successes/failures through the day. I want to answer important questions about learning (to re-enforce what I learned and store it), my diet and exercise, what I feel I did well, how my mood is/was, and if I met my intentional goals for the day. 
    - I want this evening routine to automatically generate a journal entry and add it to my notes.
- **Management**:
    - I want to be able to enter foods and build meals from them. This can be a seperate script for simplicity sake.
    - I want to do the same with exercises and workouts. I want to enter exercises and build workouts from them.
    - This should expediate the entry of repeat items in the evening routine so it never feels like a chore.

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10+
    - Chosen for its readability, extensive standard library, and rich third-party package ecosystem, making it ideal for rapid development of console applications.

- **Database:** SQLite3
    - Selected for its serverless, self-contained, and zero-configuration nature, which is perfect for a local-first, single-user desktop application. The database will be a single file on the user's machine.

- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
    - The target platform for development and deployment, providing a stable, long-term support environment.

- **Automation/Scheduling:** cron
    - The standard, time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It will be used to automatically trigger the morning and evening journal scripts at user-defined times.

- **Primary Python Libraries:**
    - **`sqlite3`**: (Standard Library) For all direct interaction with the SQLite database.
    - **`questionary`**: A third-party library for building polished, interactive command-line prompts, menus, and confirmations, enhancing the user experience.
    - **`pathlib`**: (Standard Library) For modern, object-oriented handling of filesystem paths, ensuring cross-platform compatibility if ever needed.
    - **`datetime`**: (Standard Library) For handling all date and time operations, crucial for logging and scheduling.

- **Future-Facing Libraries (for v1.0+):**
    - **`sentence-transformers`**: A third-party library for generating high-quality vector embeddings from text descriptions (learning logs, ELOs) for future semantic search and RAG integrations.
    - **`numpy`**: A foundational third-party library for numerical operations, primarily for handling and manipulating the vector data generated by `sentence-transformers`.

### Unit Tests
